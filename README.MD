# SplattAR -- Quarter 3 Project -- Swift + AR
Benjamin Broad, Ty Mondragon, Edison Toole, John Stephens-Webb

# Description
SplattAR is an experiment in augmented reality.  Users can select one of six colors and apply paint splatters with fun sound effects to vertical and horizontal experiences!  The color splat indicator in the middle of the HUD indicates what color is selected, and the trash icon can be used to clear all paint splats from the environment.
